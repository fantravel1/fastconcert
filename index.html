                        <p>FastConcert was built to eliminate endless scrolling. Our <strong>Pulse View</strong> shows a ranked radar feed — not an infinite list. Every event is scored by FastScore so the best options appear first. Filter by Tonight, Tomorrow, This Weekend, or Next 48 Hours. Filter by vibe, price, or distance. One tap to go. That's the fastest way to find a good concert tonight.</p>

                        <p>FastConcert uses <strong>Vibe Tags</strong> instead of genres. Instead of needing to know artist names, browse by vibe: Dancey, Singalong, Chill, Romantic, Heavy, Weird, Jazzy, Underground, Family-friendly, or Sober-friendly. FastScore also ranks events by venue quality, so you can discover great live music tonight without knowing a single artist name.</p>

                        <p><strong>FastScore</strong> is FastConcert's proprietary ranking algorithm. It scores every event based on: artist popularity (local + global), venue quality, uniqueness (one-night-only events), distance and travel time, price (free events get boosted), time-to-start urgency, vibe match to your taste, and social buzz. Higher FastScore means a better experience — every time.</p>
