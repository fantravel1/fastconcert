## 🎯 The Bold Positioning: Concert Radar

FastConcert is built for:
- impulse  
- spontaneity  
- last-minute decisions  

Not:
- planning months ahead  
- long descriptions  
- reading essays  

It should feel like an app you open on the street.

---

## ⚡ Tonight Mode (The Brand)

Most music apps are built for planning.

FastConcert is built for:
> **impulse + movement**

### Modes
- Tonight  
- Tomorrow  
- This Weekend  
- Next 48 Hours  

This is the entire identity of the platform.

---

## 📍 The 100km Rule (Genius)

100km is:
- big enough to include nearby cities  
- big enough to include suburbs and college towns  
- small enough to still feel local  

And it scales globally without needing separate city sites.

---

## 🆓 The Global Free-Concert Layer (Differentiator)

This is the loyalty engine.

FastConcert becomes:
> **the world’s best free live music finder.**

Sources include:
- city event calendars  
- parks departments  
- venue websites  
- universities  
- embassies / cultural institutes  
- tourism boards  
- libraries  
- community centers  
- museums  
- hotel lobbies  
- curated open mics / jazz nights  

The “free” layer creates daily-use behavior.

---

## 📊 FastScore™ (Ranking System)

FastConcert must not feel random.

Every event is ranked with **FastScore™**, based on:

- artist popularity *(local + global)*  
- venue quality  
- uniqueness *(one-night-only)*  
- distance + travel time  
- price *(free gets boosted)*  
- time-to-start urgency  
- vibe match to user taste  
- social buzz *(optional, later)*  

FastScore becomes the platform’s signature IP.

---

## 👆 One Tap to Go (UX Rule)

FastConcert is brutally simple:

Tap event → See:
- time  
- distance  
- price  
- vibe  
- “free” label clarity  

Then:
- Tap directions  
- Tap tickets *(if needed)*  
- Tap share  

No friction.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 “Bring Someone” (Bold Social Feature)

FastConcert includes a button:

> **Bring Someone**

It auto-generates:
- time  
- location  
- quick vibe label  
- link  

Because concerts are:
> social medicine.

---

## 🌈 Vibe Tags (Not Genre)

Genres are messy.
Vibes are clean.

Examples:
- Dancey  
- Singalong  
- Chill  
- Romantic  
- Heavy  
- Weird  
- Jazzy  
- Underground  
- Family-friendly  
- Sober-friendly  

This makes discovery feel modern.

---

## 🛡️ Free Concert Verification (Trust Moat)

Free events are often not truly free.

FastConcert labels clearly:

- **FREE**  
- **FREE w/ RSVP**  
- **FREE before X**  
- **FREE w/ minimum spend**  
- **DONATION**  

This honesty will make the app beloved.

---

## 🗺️ Map View + Pulse View

Two core views.

### Map View
For scanning nearby options fast.

### Pulse View
A radar feed ranked by:
- time-to-start  
- FastScore  
- distance  

Pulse View feels addictive.

---

## 🌦️ Concert Weather Layer

For outdoor shows:
- rain risk  
- temperature  
- wind  
- “bring a jacket” prompts  

This makes the product feel smart and caring.

---

## 🎟️ Last-Minute Ticket Drop Integration (Later)

Optional future layer:
- official resale  
- last-minute releases  
- day-of price drops  

Must remain:
- clean  
- anti-scalper  
- legitimacy-first  

This can connect to LimitedTicket later.

---

## 🌍 Global Scale Strategy

FastConcert does not need perfect global coverage on day one.

Launch with:
- top 30 music cities  
- best public data sources  
- heavy “free” focus  
- partner venues + event feeds  

Then expand.
The platform becomes better the more it’s used.

---

## 💰 Monetization (Clean)

FastConcert monetizes without ruining trust:

- affiliate ticket links  
- venue featured placements *(clearly labeled)*  
- premium subscription: **FastConcert+**  
  - saved taste profiles  
  - early alerts  
  - radius customization  
  - no ads  
  - “free-only mode”  

Additional:
- sponsorships for city summer concert series  

---
